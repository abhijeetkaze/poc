# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
- This repository is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for experimenting with various ideas and testing code, primarily in Python.
- The main code is located in `python/ppt-parser/ppt-parser.py`, which is currently empty and ready for new functionality.

## Directory Structure
- `python/ppt-parser/`: Contains the main parser logic. Add new features or experiments here.
- `README.md`: Brief project description. No detailed usage or workflow documentation yet.

## Development Patterns
- There are no established architectural patterns or frameworks in use. The codebase is intentionally minimal to encourage rapid prototyping.
- You are free to introduce new modules, scripts, or dependencies as needed for your experiments.
- Place new Python scripts under `python/` or in subdirectories as appropriate.

## Workflows
- No build, test, or CI/CD workflows are currently defined.
- To run scripts, use standard Python commands, e.g.:
  ```bash
  python3 python/ppt-parser/ppt-parser.py
  ```
- If you add dependencies, document them in a `requirements.txt` file in the relevant directory.

## Conventions
- Keep code and directory structure simple and easy to navigate.
- Use clear, descriptive names for new files and functions.
- Document any new workflows or conventions you introduce in the `README.md` or in this file.

## Integration Points
- No external integrations or APIs are currently present.
- If you add integrations, document them clearly in the relevant code and update this file.

## Examples
- To add a new parser, create a new script in `python/` and update the documentation.
- To experiment with a new library, add it to `requirements.txt` and note its purpose in the code comments.

If you introduce new patterns, workflows, or dependencies, update this file to help future AI agents and developers be productive quickly.
